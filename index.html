      <h3><i class="fa fa-bolt"></i> No Frills.</h3>
      <p>Other events spend lots of money on stuff you don&rsquo;t care about: flowers, dramatic lighting, and finger sandwiches. They pass that cost on to you.</p>
      <p>Not at Web Afternoon. We minimize the fluff and focus on delivering high-quality content from people in the know &mdash; at a price you can afford.</p>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-comments"></i> Top-notch Speakers</h3>
      <p>Short talks without the ego. Great Q&A. Networking with people you really want to meet. Your tribe: people like you; people who get it.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s rare for so many great people to be in one spot at the same time. New friendships form. Conversations happen. Ideas are born.</p>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Love. Not Profit.</h3>
      <p>We believe in giving back to the community. That&rsquo;s why <em>every penny</em> from our events goes straight back to help local groups groups and meet-ups.</p>
      <p>Our previous events have generated more than $5,000 for Web and technology focused groups.  And we&rsquo;re just getting started.</p>
