supplemental-section1-headline: Atlanta Welcomes You
supplemental-section1-content: <p>Web Afternoon was born here, nurtured on a diet of southern hospitality, and relentless drive. We put our all into this one. We know you&rsquo;ll love it too. In addition to having the 8th largest economy in the country, Atlanta is No. 1 among medium-sized cities for young entrepreneurs in 2013.</p>
  <p>The numbers don&rsquo;t lie, but we don&rsquo;t care if they do&#58; Atlanta is a city where things are happening, and it is the perfect location for our marquee event.</p>

supplemental-section2-headline: A Spectacular View
supplemental-section2-content: <p>A unique venue for a unique event. We&rsquo;ve taken over the entire 20th floor of the BB&T Building in Atlantic Station for a panoramic view of the city. Expect a great event with a great view.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;ll have a good supply of healthy snacks and drinks on hand, but if you&rsquo;re the super hungry type there are plenty of places nearby to grab a bite either before or after the show.</p>
